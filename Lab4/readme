COMP 322 Lab 4 Readme
Andrew Isaac

Lab 4 is a program called dining-p that simulates the dining philosophers scenario proposed by Dijkstra to demonstate deadlock. Using the launch-philosophers shell script, N processes are launched that share a chopstick semaphore with their adjacent processes in a circular fashion. Sending SIGTERM to a process stops the eat/think cycle and returns number of cycles completed prior to termination.  

10/14/14 Phase 1 complete. Still need to terminate gracefully.
10/15/14 Phase 2 complete pending allowed use of global variables passed to handler.
10/15/14 Fixed code to meet completed spec. Still waiting on allowed use of global.
10/16/14 Updated code to meet comp322.sandbox requirements. Runs on sandbox now, no longer runs on Fedora. :(
10/17/14 Completed the enhanced version. Source: launch-philosophers.c. Updated make launch to compile.
10/21/14 Changed parent program pid printf to stderr to prevent stdout conflicts with eating/thinking printf stdout.  PID was printing multiple times.
